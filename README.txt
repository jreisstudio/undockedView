The Undocked View is a Javas Script tool to undock the view from the rest of the project.

It uses only, javascript, JQuery and {{Mustache}}, and the basic idea is, is to remove the obligation of html generation on the server, using  "JSON calls" to comunicate with the "business layer" of the system.
